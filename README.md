Project
The movie Lens dataset was collected by Grouplens Research. This Movielens Dataset consists of **MovieLens 1M dataset** 
that was used to create a **movie recommendation system algorithm** which can be used to predict how a certain user will rate a certain movie.

The data was pulled directly from the MovieLens website **"http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-10m.zip"**  

The raw dataset was wrangled into a data frame, then split into the _edx_ training dataset and the _validation_ testing dataset.  

The datasets were cleaned up, wrangled, and coerced into a more useable format.  

The _edx_ dataset was explored and analyzed by plotting the data through the lenses of different potential effects.  

An equation for the root  squared error (RMSE) was defined as the target parameter.
